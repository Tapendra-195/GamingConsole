# Pin Mapping
* PD0 -> Right Button(Programming Reset Pin With pullup resistor)
* PD1 -> Buzzer(Add 220 ohm resistor to protect from over current. Not shown in schematics. All LED have 220 ohm resistor.)
* PD2 -> Row1
* PD3 -> Row2
* PD4 ->  Row3
* PD5 -> Row4
* PD6 -> Row5
* PD7 -> Row6
* PB0 -> Row7
* PB1 -> Row8
* PB2 -> Row9
* PB3 -> Up Button(MOSI for programming)
* PB4 -> Down Button(MISO for programming)
* PB5 -> Left Button(SCK for programming)

# To Program
* Connect MOSI, MISO, SCK, and Reset(PD0) of ATMega328p to pin 11, 12, 13 and 10 of Arduino Uno respectively.
* Connect the arduino uno to the computer.
* Open arduino ide. Go to File->Examples->ArduinoISP->ArduinoISP. This should open a file named ArduinoISP on the ide. Press compile and upload. Then close the file.
* Next, Open GamingConsole.ino in arduino ide. Go to Tools->Programmer and select Arduino as ISP. 
* Now go to sketch and click Upload Using Programmer. This should upload the firmware to ATMega328p. Disconnect programming pins.
